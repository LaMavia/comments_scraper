      "I gotta be frank on this, relying completely on templates seems like a bit of a step back. Especially since other games like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Skyrim, and Dark Souls were able to use sliders and Fallout 4 had a full on sculpting feature. If they're presets to choose and then build off of, that would be a very different matter but when I heard that you could spend hours customizing your character, I was thinking the appearance would have a bit more depth to it. \n\nOf course there's all the other stuff. I do like being able to customize the character's backstory similar to Mass Effect. I do hope that's well fleshed out and offers a lot of interesting but diverse options for the sort of character one would want to play as. \n\nThe clothing stuff seems alright. I do hope there's some good variation in clothing available. \n\nConcerning stats, I could have sworn that luck and empathy weren't stats in the video game. I believe Yong Yea said that.﻿",

The ESRB     just won't allow it. Hoping for a PC alternative version where it's allowed.﻿",

Es cierto que, cuando te ponías a tirar dados ahí, lo cual podía durar toda una eternidad, podía salirte no pocas cosas muy bizarras, pero, a nivel personal, siempre me parecieron muy divertidas en general, que le daban cierto toque de azar a las cosas. \n\nSi además de ésto, puede traer consecuencias en el videojuego (como ejemplo, la trilogía del Mass Effect), sucede lo que mencionas: muchas opciones de repetir el juego. El mono por éste juego empieza a alcanzar unas cotas muy muy altas.\n\nGracias por el video. Menuda alegría me has dado ^^﻿",

An open system allows to equivocate, that to me runs counter to some of the fundamental concepts of the game - go big or go home, make a decision and stick with it. These people have \"special abilities\" because that's who they are - highly talented specialists doing what they were born to do.﻿",
